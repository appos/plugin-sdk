   * `URL(string:)`, RFC 3986), NOT a WHATWG spec polyfill.
   *
   * Coherence guarantee: for the same input, `url.hostname` is the same
   * (lowercased) host string that enters the AppOS host's own security
   * normalizers (permission validation, initial-hop network checks) — so
   * plugin-side URL validation parses identically to host-side enforcement.
   *
   * ## Why the type is optional (`URLConstructor | undefined`)
   *
   * - Hosts OLDER than the injecting release (targeted for AppOS host
   *   1.1.0) do not provide the global.
   * - Menu-bar raw `JSContext` pools do not carry it in v1 — only the main
   *   plugin contexts do.
   * - Users can disable the injection with the host kill switch
   *   (`appos.jsc.urlGlobal.disabled`).
   *
   * Guard before use — `if (typeof URL === "function") { ... }` — unless
   * your manifest sets `minHostVersion` to a host release that injects the
   * global, in which case main-plugin-context code may rely on it
   * unconditionally (menu-bar contexts still must not).
   *
   * ## Pinned Foundation-vs-WHATWG divergences (intended — do not "fix")
   *
   * - Default ports are RETAINED in `href`/`port` (`:443` is not dropped).
   * - An empty path stays `""` (WHATWG would give `"/"`).
   * - Out-of-range ports are accepted.
   * - Pre-percent-encoded query values double-encode on an href round-trip
   *   (`%3A` → `%253A`).
   * - `hostname` is lowercased and IPv6 literals come WITHOUT brackets;
   *   `host`/`origin` re-bracket them (`https://[::1]:8443/x` → hostname
   *   `"::1"`, host `"[::1]:8443"`, origin `"https://[::1]:8443"`).
   * - Invalid characters are auto percent-/IDNA-encoded by Foundation
   *   (scheme-less inputs like `"not a url"` are rejected by the validity
   *   predicate, not by Foundation's parser).
   *
   * ## Out-of-subset surface (fails loudly, never silently wrong)
   *
   * - `url.searchParams`: absent from these types; the runtime getter
   *   throws a `TypeError` — parse `url.search` manually.
   * - `URL.parse(...)` static: absent in v1.
   * - Accessor setters: absent in v1 (all accessors readonly).
